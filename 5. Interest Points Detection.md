# Lec 05: Interest Points Detection
## Corner Detector
### 1. Steps
1. Find a set of distinctive key-points
2. Define a region around each keypoint
3. Extract and normalize the region content
4. Compute a local descriptor from the normalized region
5. Match local descriptors

### 2.Corner Detection: Basic Idea
- “flat” region: no change in all directions
- “edge”: no change along the edge direction
- “corner”: significant change in all directions
