# Lec 04: Filtering and Edge Features
## 1. Recap of Lec 03  
- Perspective Projection &Homography  
- SVD and an example
- HW-1

## 2. Image Filtering – A Quick Review
### Image Filters 
1. Image
- We can think of a (grayscale) image as a function 
- common to use one byte per value: 0 = black, 255 = white
	- f (x,y) gives the intensity at position (x,y) 
	- A digital image is a discrete (sampled, quantized) version of this function
2. Filter
- Modify the pixels in an image based on some function of a local neighborhood of each pixel
- Linear filtering 
	- kernel, mask, filter
	- cross-correlation
	- convolution(卷积)
- Mean filtering
- Linear filters: examples
	- Identity filter
	- Shift Filter(平移)
	- Average/Blurring(模糊化)
	- Sharpen: remove the average(锐化)
