## Summary
- Pixels not only carry color information, but also carry geometry info 
- Given 3D scene, a camera model, pixels locations on the image plane is uniquely determined 
- The reverse problem is not as easy (but deep learning is making good progress on single view depth estimation) 
- Homography: how pixels are related - implications in image retrieval

## 1. Recap of Lec 02
- Demosaicing  
- DMCNN 
- HSV (Hue, Satuation and Value/brightness) Color Model  
cone
- MPEG-7 Scalable Color Descriptor (SCD)  
H is quantized to 16 bin and S and V are quantized to 4 bins each.  
16\*4\*4 = 256 bins  
Hamming distance
- Color Histogram  
cannot capture spatial info  
**Matlab Implementation**  
  > `getHSVHist(im)` function
- Adaptive Bin Color Histogram  
SCD uses fixed color bins  
Dominant Color Descriptor  
  > Color Space Quantization (k-means)  
  > Adaptive Bin Color Histogram  
  > Distance Metric    
**Matlab Implementation**  
  > `getDominantColorHist(im,nColor)` function
